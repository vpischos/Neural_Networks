This was a demanding project for a university course called: Neural Networks. The task that was required from us was to classify 10,000 articles in approximately 18 categories and 116 subcategories using python (keras, tensorflow frameworks). We built a two-level neural network and fine tuned its parameters to achieve optimal accuracy of said classification. The project was a team effort (2 people) and required us to be familiar with Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques and experiment with many different neural network models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU etc.) and data cleaning techniques such as stemming, lematization etc. The project concluded with an in-depth paper describing our steps, methodology and results in depth.
